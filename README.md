## Summary of Research
In the Drosophila embryo, lineage tracing can be used to understand circuit development, specifically in how interactions between different lineages can shape the overall developed brain. We hope to study the phenotypic characteristics of lineages, including: axon length, association with the neuropil, growth cone size/shape, and filopodia interactions between lineages. This research is done at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as part of the Hartenstein Lab, by Dr. Volker Hartenstein and Jessica Goeij. 

## This Repo
Rmd and Html scripts in this repo performed figure generation and statistical testing of distances within 3D renders of Drosophila embryo brain.
